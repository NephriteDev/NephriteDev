## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Denys, and I'm an aspiring data professional.  

Recently, I've been working on improving my coding skills through numerous projects using Python libraries, mostly:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy, scipy and other..

Feel free to explore my portfolio of data projects [here](https://github.com/NephriteLabs/Portfolio).

I've worked on data transformation and cleaning, imported datasets into code, learned to make API requests in Python, and how to work with different data formats, such as JSON and CSV. 
Also, there's been quite a lot of SQL, advanced Excel features, and dashboarding tools such as Power BI and Tableau.

Additionally, I'm currently tackling ML, having basic experience with scikit-learn, and I plan to explore PyTorch and TensorFlow libraries later.
Big Data, NoSQL, and ML are all areas I'm interested in and aim to develop my skills in going further.

There's a lot to learn and I love it. Things don't seem to be too complicated, but there are certainly challenges. 
I do my best to put in as much effort and time as I can.

Thank you for your time, feel free to reach out or explore my page ðŸ™‚

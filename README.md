## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Denys, and I'm an aspiring data professional.  
There's a lot to learn and I love it. Things don't seem to be too complicated, but there are certainly challenges. I do my best to put in as much effort and time as I can, and I'm sure I'll get there eventually.

Right now, I've been doing a lot of Python coding and have worked on a bunch of projects with libraries, mostly:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy

I've also done API requests in JSON, transformed the data with Python, and exported it for further analysis.
Obviously, there's been quite a lot of SQL, Excel, and dashboarding tools such as Power BI and Tableau.

I also have some experience with scikit-learn, and I'm tackling ML at the moment, thinking about going into PyTorch or TensorFlow, maybe both - we'll see. 
Big Data, NoSQL, ML - these are all areas I'm planning to develop myself in further.

Thanks for your time, and take care!

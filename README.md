## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Denys, and I'm an aspiring data professional.  

Recently, I've been doing a lot of coding and have worked on projects with Python libraries, mostly:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy

I've also done data transformation and cleaning, importing / exporting datasets into code, learned to do API requests, and how to work with different data formats, such as JSON and CSV.
Also, there's been quite a lot of SQL, advanced Excel features, and dashboarding tools such as Power BI and Tableau.

I also have some experience with scikit-learn, and I'm tackling ML at the moment, thinking about going into PyTorch or TensorFlow, maybe both. 
Big Data, NoSQL, and ML are all areas I'm currently interested in and plan to further develop my skills in.

There's a lot to learn and I love it. Things don't seem to be too complicated, but there are certainly challenges. 
I do my best to put in as much effort and time as I can ðŸ’ª

Thanks for your time, and take care!
